# Password-creator

## Description

This is a webapp that generates a random password for the user. A major problem in a constantly advancing web space, is creating passwords for tons of apps that we use in our day-to-day life. This app addresses that problem.
In creating this i employed numerous techniques that make the likelihood of a repeat password near to zero. All character elements are stored in an array which is then randomized following user input. The results are then stored in an array which further shuffles the results and eventually concatenates it to produce a result.

## Usage

To use the app: 
1. Open the website by visiting:
2. Enter the length of the password
3. Enter the length of the lowercase characters
4. Enter the length of the uppercase characters
5. Enter the length of the numeric characters
6. Enter the length of the special characters

You need to enter at least one of each character type to meet secure standards. You will be prompted when you enter an invalid input. You will also be prevented from using up the entire password length before you enter at least one of each character type.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
